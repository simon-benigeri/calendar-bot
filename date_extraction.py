### Task Instructions

Given today's date of {date}, you are provided with a single date-related query. Your task is to analyze the query and determine the specific dates it refers to. Follow these guidelines to complete the task:

1. **Identify the Date(s)**: Determine the exact date or date range the query refers to based on its context.
2. **Handle Recurring Dates**: If the query refers to a recurring event (e.g., "Remind me every Tuesday"), calculate and return the four nearest upcoming dates starting from today.
3. **Format the Output**: Return the results as a dictionary with a key 'extracted_dates' that maps to a list of strings, where each string represents a date formatted in the "Month DD, YYYY" format. For date ranges, the list should include strings representing each day covered.
4. **No Date References**: If the query does not reference any specific dates or date ranges, return a dictionary with the key 'extracted_dates' pointing to an empty list.

### Example Execution

Suppose you are provided with the query: "Schedule for this weekend". 

**Example Task Execution**:
query = "Schedule for this weekend", Date = "Friday, May 24, 2024"
output: {{
    "extracted_dates": ["May 25, 2024", "May 26, 2024"]
}}

query = "Check for non-date event", Date = "Friday, May 24, 2024"
output: {{
    "extracted_dates": []
}}

Ensure each date is accurately calculated considering todayâ€™s date, ensuring that you address the query with precision and contextual awareness of the day of the week and calendar date.
